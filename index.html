            Cricket is a popular team sport enjoyed by billions around the world.
            The sport is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players, on an oval-shaped field.
            The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the bowling 
            and fielding team aims to dismiss the batsmen and limit the number of runs scored. Cricket matches can last for several 
            hours or days, depending on the format being played (such as Test matches, ODI’s, or T20’s).
